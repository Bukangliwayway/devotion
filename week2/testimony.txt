"They only heard the report: “The man who formerly persecuted us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy.” And they praised God because of me." — Galatians 1:23-24

In this chapter Paul introduced himself by reminding the people of Galatia that there is only one gospel and else are just nuissance. On the latter part of the chapter contains the testimony of Paul, the life of his from persecuter to preacher. Paul's life is quite questionable for people, like why would God let this man who persecuted his children spread His words? We know that it's beyond our udnerstanding but what we know is Paul accounts to most of books here in new testaments through his epistles, so without him we might haven't even heard about God's works in various regions. But what I really pointed here the most is these last 2 verses, Paul testified that he was once a persecuter of God's children and now a preacher of them. This just gives a powerful statement especially as he added the last verse of "And they praised God because of me". It's just that in life we couldn't really expect nor predict what may happen in our life, so live our life to the fullest instead of overthinking about those we can't even control.
