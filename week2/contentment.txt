"I rejoiced greatly in the Lord that at last you renewed your concern for me. Indeed, you were concerned, but you had no opportunity to show it. I am not saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances." — Philippians 4:10-11

In this last chapter of the book, Paul was being thankful to the Philippians for supporting him with his journey toward God. Besides Paul's act of humility to his people, what I admire the most here is the part where Paul said that he had learned to be content in whatever circumstances he may in. Contentment is something hard to achieve especially today where you can now grasp almost every information in our world, credits to the contributions that the internet as well the globalization had done in this generation. For me it takes a lot of effort to feel satisfied and achieve contentment in life as we all know that it's innate to us to get bored of something we've been familiar with. We are naturally ambitouos. We always chase new things as we see it entertaining, it fills the void in our imaginations and clears our thirst for changes. But to live chasing every new, better, and optimal approaches in life is quite tiring and it feels like unending. I think Paul is challenging us to learn to be content in life the same as he had: to live a life peacefully being satisfied for everything we had in life but still moving toward God's path. That we have to be grateful for everything we had while still moving forward in life, instead of ignoring everything we had passed and realizing the values of those when it's already too late.
