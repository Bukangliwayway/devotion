"And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him." - Collosians 3:17

The whole chapter speaks about expressing God's love, in self, each other, and to God. It was discussed here that one must love oneself and God through leaving behind every mistake that one had done from the past, and changing oneself for the better. Moreover, one must spread God's love, so that one may share the love they way they've received it from the Lord. It had discussed here also the household responsibilities for maintaining peacefulness and expressing the love of God. There are messages for husband, wife, child, as well for workers. That one must respect one another, themselves, and their jobs. As it glorifies not only the Lord but themselves and their society as well.
I chose this verse as I think it had summed up the whole chapter. This basically tell us that we must dedicate ourselves to the Lord. That to make sure what we're doing fall along God's will, as we mainly represent Him through our deeds. The main message I had here is that one must learn to reflect back to the simplest structure of their complex struggles in life and to understand the root behind all of the whys and hows of their life.
