"Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up." — James 4:10

The whole chapter addresses the conflicts one may have encounter when they followed their ungodly desires, leading them to troubled and ruined life. The main message I got in this chapter is that we must realize that our self is the absolute representation of the result of every battle that is going on inside us. But it depends always on us which side we will strengthen and weaken. I think it requires a more than just our judgment to always know which side to prefer. Our understanding is somehow vulnerable with forces that we cannot handle. There will always be situations where it will confuse our understanding of what's the logical choice should be. So the bible suggest that we submit ourselves onto the Lord and let Him be. To humble ourselves and realize that we are mortal being and limited in our physical measures is the wisest thing we could do.
