"My dear brothers and sisters, if someone among you wanders away from the truth and is brought back, you can be sure that whoever brings the sinner back from wandering will save that person from death and bring about the forgiveness of many sins." — James 5:19-20

James 5 is a message of comfort for standing firm on one's faith even on the face of cruel world. That one must be still and unshakable on fighting its faith against the storm of oppression. As living in the right will be always the right thing to do. It had discussed there the pathetic cruelty of the world followed by promises for being patient in the face of suffering and keeping one's faith. The message I got here is that one must be delighted if they suffer because of their faith, as it is the most precious battle that one could participate.
I chose this verse as I realized how critical for us to stay in contact with each other when it comes with keeping one's faith. As this creates a bond of unity so that if anyone dares or been lured to give up, others can quickly recover it up. It's like the scene in the infamous series Squid Game where the protagonists team up to cover each other against those who dare to hunt them down during lights off. Before I stop I just wanna say here that the greatest favor one could serve to others is to save their soul from being drowned in the ocean of falsehood.
