Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted. - Matthew 5:4

The whole chapter contains sermons, and promises as well, that are dedicated for people who encounters struggles in life; to bear with themselves. And I chose this verse over all not because I do mourn over something right now but because I admire those people who can mourn or be sad whenever they want. For they are aware of their emotions and know how to handle it. For me, being sad means being aware of one's situation; and being able to express one's insides and determine when will there be triggers. It just proves that one had mastered themselves and could manage their emotions optimally. Sadness is a burden one unknowingly suffer, and the longer it stays the heavier it gets. The only way to unload it is by expressing it freely, by squeezing it out of one's heart. But it's when one is not aware of their pain that the sorrow could possibly be stiff and eventually be numb of the pain. A zombie with no emotion at all. An outcast who  cannot comprehend the emotions of others.
That's why to feel sad is a blessing as it gives us way to express and release the burdens we carry on life, a comforting mechanism. So mourn when we feel like it for God will be there for us with a handkerchief, ready to comfort us. Never keep it inside, for it scatters like a cancer and blasts like a bomb. Squeeze it out of our heart before it contaminates it.
