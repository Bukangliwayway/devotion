"Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you." — 1 Peter 5:7

Before I start I'd like to inform that I got this verse from a friend of mine who have a pure heart in which I really admire. This hits differently whenever I look back onto past and think about her and the philosophies we've shared along the way. Okay moving on, this chapter is the end of the book, one can confirm it by the goodbye messages that was written in the last part of it. The topic, actually, is about serving those who are more capable and being humble as well not just to the leader but also to others. This speaks mainly about humility, that one must be humble for it to understand the lesson and show respect as well. As one cannot focus on the message if there's a voice inside that contradicts every incoming lesson.
This verse gives comfort to those people who struggle in following God's will as their thoughts push them away from it. Anxiety is a heavy burden that one endure in their everyday living. This might be thoughts about their possessions, jobs, one's expectations, and other forces that gives them negative impact on their thought processing. It's one of the major issue especially in this generation as our society pressures us with the overwhelming growth of our industry. To think about it seems hard to address for it is a subjective problem, one bears different version of it. But here it was just written, simply, that we can cast away all of it for God cares upon us. It's simple yet hits hard especially when you're on the verge of a breakdown. This comforting verse might had already saved countless lives and changed one's life too. Before I finish, I'd like to leave here a piece of message that had struck me suddenly: that whenever we feel not okay just think that we're not alone on this fight and that there's someone who thinks highly of us so embrace it and fight, for we know that God has never given us challenge that we can't end.
