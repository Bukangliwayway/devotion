"All go to the same place; all come from dust, and to dust all return." - Ecclesiastes 3:20

What he meant by the term "all" here is the animals and humans. That Solomon thought human also lives like animals. Been born, given birth, had survived the nature, lived, and died; but just in different approaches. I think what Solomon is trying to point out here is that we are no good compared to animals, and the only thing that distincts us from them is our consciousness, that gives us awareness as well satisfaction in life. And this is a gift of God for us to endure. What life is without those driving chemicals in our head that encourages us to survive and strive for something? The message I learned here is that we must embrace how empty we are actually in this world. We're no one but just some creature that has a consciousness, a gift given by God. So cherish life for every breath we take, as that's what we're meant to be. Master ourselves through the use of our senses and live a life that pleases God.
