Everyone comes naked from their mother’s womb, and as everyone comes, so they depart. They take nothing from their toil that they can carry in their hands. - Ecclesiastes 5:15

At the second part of the chapter entitled "Riches are meaningless", Solomon said that people's toils here on Earth are meaningless as it is only temporary. For him it's nothing but a waste of life just to taste the temporary happiness given by the wealth of the world. The only right thing to do is to give up one's toil to God and let Him show you the happiness with one's toil as well in life. Being rich sometimes takes hardships and various toils that are necessary for them to encounter, unlike the rich from God. Only one's toil in life would be worth it if one could enjoy both the toil and the outcomes of it. 
The lesson that I think I learned here is that live life simply, for life's always simple as long as we perceive and understand its simplicity. From dust, to dust. That one must seek not the riches of the word but the riches in one's heart that is drawn by God's words.
