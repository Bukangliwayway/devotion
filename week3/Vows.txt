"It is better not to make a vow than to make one and not fulfill it" - Ecclesiastes 5:5

This verse belongs from the first part of the chapter entitled "Fulfill your vows to God". Solomon had wrote here that vows especially to God are sacred and must not be stained by foolishness of one's heart. Vows must be fulfilled the exact way, else it would be a sin and a disrespect as well. So in life one must always think twice and be mindful of giving vows, for vows are made to be fulfilled not to be broken. Moreover, we mortals are just a creature of the Earth so the vows made for heaven must be handled more delicately.
The lesson I learned here is that in life be mindful of making promises to anyone. As it seems like you're trying to give them hope, as well yourself a chance for them to trust you. So by not taking it seriously it's you who lose, as you might have hurted them and especially tore their trust. Trust is one of the most special gift anyone could share to oneself, and it's one of the most difficult to give, as well to receive. Henceforth, I will never ever promise anything that I wasn't sure about. Better never than a broken promise.
