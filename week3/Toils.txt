For a person may labor with wisdom, knowledge and skill, and then they must leave all they own to another who has not toiled for it. This too is meaningless and a great misfortune. - Ecclesiastes 2:21

I haven't had this view before in life. I've spent most of my life, besides entertainment, working hard on something I'm not entirely certain about. I just hop in whatever my present dilemmas offer me. I'm not saying I hadn't had a second thought every time in doing so but it's just, for me, gives me something to do in life that will cure me from the drudgery of living. And to view this, referring almost my entire life, as meaningless and nonsense is purely depressing. I always see him as someone who got egoistic just because he had done so much success in life that it gave him an illusion of a position to judge what life is. But right now or just for now, I think he's making sense actually. BTW I haven't had read the entire summary of this book so I still have no idea whether Solomon will state what's the only thing that isn't meaningless in life. That life here is just temporary. Temporary as everything we had done and will have done here in this life will be forgotten and be erased in this world eventually.
The lesson I got here is that to never invest life on something meaningless, or temporary. Although I clearly have no idea what to do with that wisdom but I think this is a way for us to realize, to look back on who we really are, and to know how small we are compared to the huge void in our intellectual race, composing this questions we couldn't answer yet or will never be. So why spend life on something soon other people will only enjoy? We must never be too attached on anything we do in life or else it will be a weight in our heart.
