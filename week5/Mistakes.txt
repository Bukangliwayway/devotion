"As dead flies give perfume a bad smell, so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor." - Ecclesiastes 10:1

Here Solomon told us that folly is powerful and could disregard whatever we've done no matter how wise we have been before. It's a simple piece of advice for us to be aware and be cautious upon our actions as little folly could literally waste every great things we had done from the past. 
For me, our mistakes seems heavier than our success, especially in the eye of anyone that surrounds us. As being correct is just and expected, yet mistake is plainly remarkable, unusual and could be unpredictable. There's so much way to do mistake than to do something correctly, that's why mistakes are just way more complex and interesting. That it's easier to crumple a paper than to straighten it back. 
Mistake is a mistake but we all are aware that this too is indeed part of our life; that even mistake itself  helps us grow and become more right. Although I think not in every case we could apply this logic. How about mistakes that are irreversible? Like hurting someone?
I think we must try most of the time to be always right in every circumstances and try to think critically before we act. That it's fine to do mistake, but only for as long as it is justifiable and reasonable.
