- Ecclesiastes 12:12
"Be warned, my son, of anything in addition to them. Of making many books there is no end, and much study wearies the body."

In the final chapter of this book, Solomon concluded that nothing we do really matters except our faith with God and by keeping His commandments. For in the end whatever we had done for the world will be replaced and forgotten but those we had done for and against God will live through our consciousness for as long as we live, and be used to judge us in the end.
 This verse speaks mainly about those people who strive to fight the big question marks of existence. Making books to describe, share, and expand what we know will never cease. The discovery of things will somehow fill us up but soon will be forgotten. The exploration of our thoughts is unending although we're trapped in it. We are in the middle of nowhere and will never get any closer to our destination for it might be none, or just we have or still have no idea about it. We are mortal, we deteriorate, we get old, we die, and the only way to fight the current of questions is by embracing the fact that we have lost already,  that we're hopeless and will never answer it all. The simplicity of life depends on how we perceive it. If we strive to lighten up those that are in the dark, it will require a lot of energy, so life will be difficult. But if we chose to live with the light, life will be simple yet dependent. But either way it's nonsense. I see no wrong with any of it, there's just this choice that makes us who we are, and fills our void inside for some time.
