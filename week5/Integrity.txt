Job 2:10
He replied, “You are talking like a foolish woman. Shall we accept good from God, and not trouble?” In all this, Job did not sin in what he said.

This was the line Job said to his wife as she had questioned his faith to God. It was after Job had a sore on his whole body and he showed his firmness through it by laying on the ashes. I'm not sure but his words here are powerful and encouraging.
 I have no idea how painful it is to have those pores but I'm sure it's awful that you'll better be dead than live a day with it. This verse just shows that living life is not always about happiness and peace, it's also about troubles that are perhaps naturally part of life. 
 But the real challenge here actually is how to maintain faith during those troubles in life. Job is telling us in this verse that we must embrace the random journey of our life. Because in the end, whether it might be or not just happened for the better of ourselves, but by embracing and accepting those in our life is indeed a necessary way to survive and get over through those times.
