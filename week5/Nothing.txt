Job 1:21
and said: 
“Naked I came from my mother’s womb, 
    and naked I will depart. 
The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away; 
    may the name of the Lord be praised.”

This verse might be used for quite frequent but UI wanna include it on my devotion as well since this is one of the firmest line I've read in the Bible. I'm sure Job is aware that it's a supernatural event, and for sure a work of some mystical creature. Imagine losing all you have in just one strike? The kids, the source of wealth, and everything you own?! That's absurdly terrifying. At first I admit that I felt somehow toxic with what Job had done, knowing that he's aware that it might be a doing of God. But I realized afterwards that it makes sense anyway, a firm faith indeed. Although I just hate that his children and servants have to die only because of it. Perhaps the concept of owning is just way different already compared to our current generation. But anyway, Job is right, a nihilist approach would be a great move regarding these situations. That we are no one, absolutely nothing but a peck of dust. And yep that we just receive blessings from the Lord, and what we do consider belongs to us is just an illusion of ownership, because in fact we really don't own nor control anything.
