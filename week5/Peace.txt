Job 1:9
“Does Job fear God for nothing?” Satan replied.

I'm not quite sure what to say about this verse but I felt that it somehow says something, and I couldn't recognize it yet.
Before I start, I just wanna explain here how I got to the book of Job. Last night I had just finished the book of Ecclesiastes, with such an awesome point of view: That life indeed is pointless and unfortunately that's all, a chase after the wind. I tried reading the Songs of Solomon but kinda got bored of its topic. I kinda hate its genre, it's just love between two lovers, no point at all. Though there's one in the end of the book that concludes the whole story, but I don't think it's worth doing devotion for. So I searched on YT and watched some summary of Ecclesiastes book and found in its comment section that besides Ecclesiastes, Job also speaks a lot about practical life here on Earth. And that's how I got here.
Okay going back, at first read I laughed that Satan is way curious with this man named Job. But the second time I read it, it somehow made sense. Job was so blessed yet he didn't have any good story about acquiring it. He just was so close to God and so God blessed him. But anyway, he should have some story to give some thrill, kidding. The concept seems like a quote probably from Sun Tzu, that if there's peace, there's surely a war. What got me here is that only using a single verse, the book explained to us that we must know who is God and especially why we fear Him, as a preparation for us to defend ourselves when time comes.
