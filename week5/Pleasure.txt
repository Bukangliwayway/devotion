Ecclesiastes 12:1
Remember your Creator 
    in the days of your youth, 
before the days of trouble come 
    and the years approach when you will say, 
    “I find no pleasure in them”

I think this sums up the whole topic of this chapter. We all share this feeling and we've experienced this quite often this time especially if you're like me who quickly get tired of doing something drudgery. I think it's natural for us to really get bored of something we felt the opposite before. It's hard to keep ourselves satisfied with something or someone we live with for time. We sometimes fall into monotonous events of life that we tend to evade as it gives us nothing new. We learn nothing from it, and I think that's why we feel bored because we see ourselves composed of unending thoughts that give us the will to explore life. Enough with that but what I learned from this is that we have to cherish and appreciate whatever it is that we have, because soon it will  become meaningless. It's like the lyrics from one of my fav music: "everything we touch surely dies". We're like this fire that chemically changes whatever we touch as we are destined to be just like that. We get excited over new things we encounter and ruin it the moment we have it. So that's it, we must cherish life as long as we can.
