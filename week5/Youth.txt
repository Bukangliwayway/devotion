"You who are young, be happy while you are young, and let your heart give you joy in the days of your youth. Follow the ways of your heart and whatever your eyes see, but know that for all these things God will bring you into judgment."  - Ecclesiastes 11:9

In this chapter, Solomon is encouraging everyone to live life although not in a risky or extreme approach but in a way that we confront our fear and destroy it. Life is all about breaking through limitations, learning from each of it, and growing as well from it. Being stopped by fear and doubt basically means being dead. I think what he's trying to tell us here is that we must cast away most of our anxieties and try to live life however we like it. We must not over think of every outcome for no one knows what's ahead unless it's so bad that it results in obvious disaster. And also in the end it's all worthless, thinking so much and investing time and energy in holding back just for some meaningless goal we think represents us being successful is foolish and just a waste of life. Just try it out, and live it out.
In this verse however, he's pointing to youths. That youth must appreciate and be gratitude upon blessed health they currently have. So live life and enjoy it for soon it will be all over, that soon everything will be meaningless. But he also warned youth here that be mindful that in the end, there's still a God who will judge their deeds.
