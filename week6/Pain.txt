Job 3:10
for it did not shut the doors of the womb on me to hide trouble from my eyes.

The whole chapter is named "Job Speaks" this contains every rant of Job against almost all things except God. He blamed the birth of his, for it did not made any way just to stop him from being born, to hide trouble from his eyes as he said in this verse. 
This is just way too painful, but also showed that Job is emotional and could feel pain and have breakdowns too, just like us. He wished that he better been not born at all, and died with the most peaceful death ever known. For him, it would be better to be in heaven quickly than to live through this pithole. 
I chose this verse because I see it as the peak of his pain. This is when he revealed why he want to curse everything that happened during his birth. That death is better than the life itself.
The lesson I learned from this verse is that it's okay to be emotional, acknowledge the pain that is constantly poking us; and to let those emotions flow out of us for that is the best way to contain ourselves and to let ourselves and others know that we are just human, we feel pain and we have emotions to handle. We get full just like pail that overflows when tears are just way too much.
