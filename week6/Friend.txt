Job 4:6
Should not your piety be your confidence 
    and your blameless ways your hope?

The 4th chapter of Job is from Eliphaz, Job's friend. The whole chapter including the next chapter contains pep talks and motivating words for Job and his fight. Here Eliphaz is trying to comfort Job over sufferings it had gone, just him being a good friend. This depicts what a good friendship must be and for me Eliphaz is quite fit to be a role model of whom you have to be friends with in life. 
 In this verse Eliphaz pointed out who and what Job has been to every person that surrounds him and how it differed after he had those misfortunes. Job had helped them during their hard times and been an inspiration to them. Through his word he filled them with hope and strengthened their faith but now, as Eliphaz said, he couldn't even help himself? What I do love in this verse is that Eliphaz questioned Job, as a true friend, about his firmness and what happened to his faith. That he must remain and be more faithful especially in that moment as he is currently encountering the challenge of his life.
