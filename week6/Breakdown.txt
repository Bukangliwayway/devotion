Don’t I have a right to complain?
    Don’t wild donkeys bray when they find no grass,
    and oxen bellow when they have no food?
Don’t people complain about unsalted food?
    Does anyone want the tasteless white of an egg?
- Job 6:5-6

What I do love in this part is how Job showed us that he too is a vulnerable one and not like what we expect from the story that he would endure every pain just for the glory of God. We sometimes fail and it's pretty normal for us since we are just mortals who are limited by physics. And for Job, that too is normal for even our mind and spirit could handle such pain but when our body gives up, we then break down. Breakdowns I think is the message of ourselves or our body to ourselves that we must take a rest for a while as it can't continue anymore. Going back to Job, he questioned here that we are people, more than donkeys or oxen, and that we have emotions and senses, so we must have a right to complain and vent out all our heavy feelings that we carry on our short lives.
