"How painful are honest words! But what do your arguments prove?" - Job 6:25

The whole chapter 6 is about Job responding to Eliphaz about everything it told him. This is full of anguish that results in Job asking when he could have his rest and also even blaming his friends as toxic and unreliable.
Here Job responds to his friends, iritately. He felt that his friends judged him without understanding his situation. Well, he hasn't done anything wrong so of course it's wrong to kee[ blaming him for something that he didn't commit. 
The verse I think serves as a lesson for us to keep in mind that being honest is wise but to know when to use it is wiser. Truth being told in unnecessary events would just become nonsense and could only inflict pain or trouble to someone. I don't suggest lying or anything wrong in exchange of honesty but I think silence is enough already. That the truth must be heard from those who truly must tell it.
