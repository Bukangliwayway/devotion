For hardship does not spring from the soil,
    nor does trouble sprout from the ground.
Yet man is born to trouble
    as surely as sparks fly upward.
- Job 5:6-7

I really love the metaphor of trouble and the sparks flying upward due to some force blowing it up. I like to imagine it as a swordsmith that smashes their craft which is so hot enough that it causes some sparks to fly upward. Here Eliphaz is trying to tell us that the troubles we encounter in our daily life come up not from anywhere besides individuals itself. We think of our problems as something caused by someone or something that we blame it on anything we could think of, even though we are the only ones who think that that certain event is a problem. Problem is neither good nor bad, well it depends on one's perception but for me the problem is the rerouter of our life. Problem is part of our life, it is where we are given a chance to either be good or bad.
