Job 5:8
[8]“But if I were you, I would appeal to God; 
    I would lay my cause before him.

What I actually want to do as my devotion tonight are the verses 6 and 7 but I couldn't explain it myself. I'm missing some ideas perhaps that's why I couldn't picture it out myself. So for tonight I chose this verse, it's from Eliphaz and it's an advice to Job as he had been low with faith. Here Eliphaz wants to tell us that for any troubles that we encounter, he reminds us that there is God out there that is willing to assist us and comfort us.
I think what I learned here is that we are lucky that we have God whom to call in times of trouble. Through prayer we can eradicate ourselves from impending troubles that are yet to come in our life. So talk to God as always, for we have troubles to fight for every moment of our lives.
