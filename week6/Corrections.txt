Job 5:17
[17]“Blessed is the one whom God corrects; 
    so do not despise the discipline of the Almighty.

For everyday living, we receive various sermons from other people whenever we do some mistakes, or we barely do, overdid it, and even do nothing at all. It is inevitable as people will always say something about us. So instead of despising those I guess the better approach is to just embrace it and think of it like an accidental lesson, if it is so pointless then call it an unnecessary lesson. So either way it is still a lesson that we must give some time to ponder upon. It's the same thing with our God. The only difference is He can't tell us directly through whatever means it is besides our faith, senses, and through our connection with God--through prayer. It is always a blessing to be kind of smacked by God, for it's certainly a great lesson in life. So come on, let's make mistakes, to be smacked and blessed by God over and over again. Kidding, since it's a lesson we must apply it to ourselves so that we'll never do it again.
 Although I don't get the idea of it being applied to Job's situation. Job hasn't done anything wrong, it's actually the opposite thing. Whatever, well for me this shows that a friend's advice will never be that accurate enough but it is sufficient and more than enough already to be listened to by them. Perhaps I also learned that we must not give advice unless they asked to, or we already know their whole situation.
