"If the ax is dull and its edge unsharpened, more strength is needed,  but skill will bring success." - Ecclesiastes 10:10

I find this one interesting. It seems like an art that could contain various interpretations. I think I'll reside through understanding it with an application to normal life. That if you're born poor and lacking opportunities you have to work hard and invest so much time in toils to move forward in life, but only if you're wise enough that you become successful in life. 
If we think that the game of life is just plain hardworking and living through expected and necessary pain and sufferings in life, we might have been mistaken. There is always a better way to live life and that's through being wise and optimal with our energy, time, and sacrifices we spend on daily basis.
 I'm not entirely sure with the real definition of being successful in life but for me it is by embracing the reality and accepting the fact that everything goes cold, and so our warmness and happiness. We like things and soon we ignore it or even hate it, for it is destined to be just like that. For me, the only way to win life is to accept that we're all losers and incapable of achieving anything. Ironic isn't it? But I think because it's when we accepted how weak we are that we realize and appreciate our strengths and our faith to something we're not sure about. As we've already broken our hope to be anyone, we are all-in and indulged in whatever we do. For we have nothing to lose besides ourselves. 
 So be good, no matter what happen always choose good, and soon it will matter as it's the wisest thing to do: accepting the fact that we are no one and so do the others, so try to be good upon one another for that's when we become someone.
