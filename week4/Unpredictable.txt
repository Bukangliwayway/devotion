When I applied my mind to know wisdom and to observe the labor that is done on earth—people getting no sleep day or night— then I saw all that God has done. No one can comprehend what goes on under the sun. Despite all their efforts to search it out, no one can discover its meaning. Even if the wise claim they know, they cannot really comprehend it. - Ecclesiastes 8:16-17

In these verses, Solomon realized that whatever we do is pointless, a chase after the wind as he always say. That even when people do try hard living in life, there's a chance thqt one may not gain the same loss they've paid upon working it. As it all depends with God. It's not us who create ourselves, but it's God who had written it already before we even exist. 
The lesson I learned here is that we must accept in life that we are no one. Whatever we do in life, how painful we had gone through, and however hard the work we've paid for it, there will be always a chance that life might fail in front of us, but that's totally fine. I think we must always spare some space in our heart for negatives that might happen in our life, so that when time comes and a sudden failure happened, we are prepared to embrace it and accept it as part of our life. Life indeed is unpredictable.
