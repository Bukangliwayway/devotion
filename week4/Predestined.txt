When times are good, be happy;  but when times are bad, consider this: God has made the one as well as the other. Therefore, no one can discover anything about their future - Ecclesiastes 7:14

This is written by Solomon referring to his definition of wisdom. That when times are good then be happy and if it is not, then just think that God made that because he has a plan for you. Life is full of misery and pain, and it would be tiring and indeed a waste of energy if you'll try to avoid it through seeking entertainment and pleasure in this world. One must embrace the negatives in their life so that they can appreciate it.
The lesson I learned here is that whatever happens to us whether it's good or bad, just think God has done it for us to be better in our life. No one will ever know what might happen in our lives, but all we know is that God made it all. Just keep in mind that God always do what is right for us, so trust God. There's no accident, everything is written and planned accordingly.
