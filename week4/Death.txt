Anyone who is among the living has hope—even a live dog is better off than a dead lion! - Ecclesiastes 9:4

The subsequent verses talked about the common destiny everyone shares: death. That whatever you do, how good you are, how bad you are, you'll eventually die. And to die is surely the last thing anyone can do. In death, there is nothing but peace and the vanishing of one's entire identity within the world.
 Here Solomon is telling us that we have hope for as long as we live. So live life to the fullest for we are always do have hope. That we must not lose hope for we are still alive. We have no idea what the future may be for us but certainly we know is that we have future. So enjoy life and stay alive, for death is inevitable yet life is unpredictable.
 That it's when we die that we cease to be.
