Anyone who is among the living has hope—even a live dog is better off than a dead lion! - Ecclesiastes 9:4

The subsequent verses talked about the common destiny everyone shares: death. That whatever you do, how good you are, how bad you are, you'll eventually die. And death is the last thing one can do. In death, there is nothing but peace and the vanishing of one's entire identity within the society. Here Solomon is telling us that we have hope for as long as we live. That we must not lose hope for we are still alive. We have no idea what the future will look like for us but the only thing we know is that we have future. So enjoy life and stay alive, for death is inevitable yet life is unpredictable.
 It's when we die that we cease to be.
