There is something else meaningless that occurs on earth: the righteous who get what the wicked deserve, and the wicked who get what the righteous deserve. This too, I say, is meaningless. - Ecclesiastes 8:14

Here Solomon is trying to explain to us that the world does not follow our morals and rules. That it's not always when we do good, we receive good. In fact it's indeterminable, for no one really knows what's ahead of time. He's trying to tell us here that we have to realize in life that it is indeed unfair and that's fine to know. That we must be stoic in life: embrace the unfair cycle of our life for that too is a part of living.
What I learned here is that the world doesn't care about our values in life, how we perceive it and how we convey judgment over anything. So don't expect that people will always follow you, nor appreciate whatever philosophy or moral code you have live in life. There will always be these people who will question it and perhaps might give you  either a lesson or just an annoyance. In life, we must understand that we are distinct from each others, that we are decentralized when it comes with opinions and ideologies that contains us. So yepp Solomon's right, that it is meaningless to force people to follow our rules and how we like it to work.
