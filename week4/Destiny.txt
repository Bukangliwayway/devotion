 I have seen something else under the sun: The race is not to the swift or the battle to the strong, nor does food come to the wise or wealth to the brilliant or favor to the learned; but time and chance happen to them all. - Ecclesiastes 9:11

This one is a beautiful message for us all. That in life and in whatever we do, we does not represent anything until we have gained the outcome, where the outcome become us. When a man win the race he become swift, but what if that man didn't joined the race at all? Could anyone call him swift? I think what Solomon is trying to tell us here is that we're no one until our destiny show to us who we are and what we are capable of. And that life is indeed a matter of luck as well favor of time and opportunities. No, actually we're not no one for it's when we die we become completely no one.
What I learned here is that we must not think in any time that we are dead weight and meaningless, for we are all have innate purpose and have destiny to fulfill. When life shows you how useless you are just think that you're just in a journey toward that destination that will soon become who you are. That perhaps today we're indeed no one but soon we will be someone, as we're destined for something. Although we must think that we are still responsible and have free of will in life, for the destination is perhaps already made but the journey toward there is still up to us.
