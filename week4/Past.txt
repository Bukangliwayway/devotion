Do not say, “Why were the old days better than these?” For it is not wise to ask such questions. - Ecclesiastes 7:10

Solomon here just simply advised us that we must not compare our present onto our past for it might be a different thing, well I dunno he didn't even told here the reason why. As you know, I'm a man of history. I appreciate the value of the past as for me it serves as a lesson for us that we can use as we move forward into our future. And I think we must compare our present to the past whatever the reason is. For the past is gone and so their lesson is ripe, it had reached already the outcome. I couldn't follow why he said here as he provided no reason behind so Imma choose my opinion this time. Perhaps in preceding chapters he might prove himself.
What I learned here is that one must not perhaps, as what I think he's trying to say here, compare one's past to its present as it's a distinct from one another and that could lead not to similar outcome when applied.
