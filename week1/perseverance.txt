"Let us not become weary in doing good, 
for at the proper time we will reap a harvest
if we do not give up" 
Galatians 6:9

I got this from a story "Doing Good to All" encompassing the first verse of this chapter up to its 10th verse. Well it generally speaks about the unity, the utopia of doing kindness to each one that results, eventually, to peacefulness. Well I barely believe in that as I think it's nature in us, humans, to be selfish and I think it takes a lot of effort and altruism in order to achieve the peacefulness were trying to advocate. Guess that's why we have to persevere not only in doing kindness and lifting each one to the top but by trying to deny as well our selfishness, the nature trait we had from this world.

I've read and even heard this quite often before but it's this night it has struck me hard. It feels like perseverance suits me tonight as I had done nothing throughout the whole day. (yah I know, the contrary) Dunno but I see it as that we get tired, spiritually tired, when we had done nothing in relevance to God's will. That only if we had followed His will that we won't get tired, I mean we still do, physically, but I'm sure it's worth it as it is our spirit who had gained the whole time. To sum it all up and before I go, all I want to say is that for as long as what we're doing something and we're aware that it has a good result or consequences even though it's tough, cherish it. I think it's when we're doing something we live our live, our purpose. The tougher it is, the lifer it will do us.
