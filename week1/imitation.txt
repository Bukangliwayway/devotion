Dear friend, do not imitate what is evil but what is good. Anyone who does what is good is from God.Anyone who does what is evil has not seen God.
3 John 1:11

The whole chapter was written by John commending someone named Gaius for being with truth as what other people had testified about him. In this chapter Gaius was not present, guess he's somewhere else, though it wasn't mentioned either. Well it was written in a form of a letter, thanking him for everything he had done on the unnamed church that had testified about his works even under negative circumstances. Well I hope that this had reached Gaius for it's such a heart melting message. 

Moving on, well what I liked about this verse, mostly, is that after reminding Gaius of whom to imitate and defining that people falls in accord to the polarity of good and bad, John addressed those who does evil as someone who has not seen God yet instead of directly calling it evil. Dunno why I expected it to be, but I really appreciate that he's implying here that those who does evil might just have no idea of why they're doing it, an innocent, and that they just need to see God and be loved by God in order to change their understanding of themselves as well their surroundings and eventually do good, just like how it must be.
