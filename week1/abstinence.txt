“It is God’s will that you should be sanctified: that you should avoid sexual immorality; that each of you should learn to control your own body in a way that is holy and honorable” — 1 Thessalonians 1:3-4

To understand the whole chapter we have to look back first and know the context and the history of Thessalonia. Thessalonia is a former pagan city that had been trapped in a rough vice of sexual immorality. This chapter is about Paul building up the society from ruins through maintaining order in which was mainly about an abstinence from sexual immorality. For Paul knew that people would easily fall back into their former self even after being converted if temptations are still in existent. And that people must understand that sexual immorality is a disrecpect to their own body and to the Lord. 
Here this is just a piece of command yet presents a deep root of major problems that unknowingly cripples their society. For me this to verse could be used not only for Thessalonians and its abstinence from sexual immorality, but also to us. Not only of sexual immorality but in every form of sins that rules over us. Since we’re unique and so our vices, we have to apply what Paul said here that we must abstain ourself from our former sins and let ourselves free so that we could walk and serve God in lightweight.
