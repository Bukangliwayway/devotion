“This is my gospel, for which I am suffering even to the point of being chained like a criminal. But God’s word is not chained.”—2 Timothy 2:9

In this book, 2 Timothy, Paul was held captive for the second time at Rome. He was hidden in a cell where most of his friends couldn’t find him. Here he is writing this as an advice as well his last words to someone which he called figuratively as his beloved son—Timothy. This book is kinda disheartening as this had been his last book before he was persecuted. That even before his actual death, he died doing God’s work.
Reading this verses had hit me differently as I realized that this has been his last book shortly before he died. Here he fought for his faith even though he’s suffering already. If I were in his position I would literally question it like I spread freedom but why I am imprisoned like this? To compare it today, what Paul did is like sharing the bible in North Korea—illegal. Here he said that even he was chained, he’s still fighting for he know that the word he had shared during his time was already growing, that it is unchained. That the word, or idea is now revolutionizing the whole world that until today it’s still existing. What I do admire about Paul here is that he died yet he still lived through the word of God, for he did the right thing as he followed God. Making me conclude that the best death one could do is to leave its artworks or contribution living until the very end.
