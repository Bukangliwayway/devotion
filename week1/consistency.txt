"Each person should remain in the situation they were in when God called them."
1 Corinthians 7:20

This belongs to the story, regarding concerns about changing status, within the chapter that talks primarily about a choice of living a married life as well as the unmarried. At some part of this chapter, I think it tries to consider the passion of someone with being in love by marrying it instead of commiting the sin of perhaps a premarital sex. Well it's such a heavy topic I could say. My stand with immature sex is kinda unbalanced. Marrying someone just to not commit sin is a joke, obviously. I think it defies the sacredness, or the serious concept of nuptial, to be commited and tied to the one you're about marry for a lifetime. They can just refrain from it instead of ruining someone's life just to not commit sin. I do understand that passion is innate on human nature and that considering it a sin makes it actually inconceivable, but I believe it adresses a much worse problem from their culture as well in our generation, so that makes sense. The concerning sensitive topic of sexual life I think belongs to those who have a total view of every outcomes of it. Well guess who's that would be.

Okay moving on, the verse belongs to the topic of being still when called. The analogy of being circumsized or not is somehow vague but could be subjectively interpreted. For me it speaks about being consistent on who you are, when called. What I mean by this is that keeping God's command is what really do matters. That when you are called, you must stay on Him. To relate it with my life, I see it as that I have to be consistent with the habit of doing devotion, as well as those that are similar to it, the prayer, the application of God's word, and trying not to commit sin.
